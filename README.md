was looking for a fun side project to get in my coding each day. I want to do this outside of work so I have it to fall back on when it's all paperwork.

So, if I was going to have a micro learning app what would I want it to do:

- handle multiple subjects 
- send a piece of Learning each day
- on each learning have space for me to interact and make notes/comments
- allow me to toggle if I want a single subject or randomize
- authenticated

The above would require
- persistence of data 
	- simple db backend?
- front end?
	- could be cli but... could start with a cli interface 
- how to deliver results
- metrics - prometheus and datadog
